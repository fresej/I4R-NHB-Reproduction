This is the replication data for my robustness reproduction of 
"Dietrich, B. and Sands, M.: 2023, Seeing racial avoidance on New York City streets, Nature Human Behaviour 7(8), 1275â€“1281.". 
This reproduction effort is part of the mass reproduction initiative for articles published in Nature Human Behaviour from 2023 onwards, 
which is organized by the Institute for Replication.

The script "robustness replication" contains all my code for the three robustness checks. It interacts with the dataset "nyc_data.csv".
